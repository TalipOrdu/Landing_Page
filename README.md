# Responsive_web_page
I created a web page with semantic elements. Firstly I made a navbar and added some links about training, courses,contact links. I gave a lite bit introduction about me . I write some courses and used lorem texts. Finally  I used a footer and gave a form you can write down here your ideas or  recommendation  and social media links.
